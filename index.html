<a id="problem-statement" class="anchor" href="#problem-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Statement.</h3>

<p>Amputees deserve a normal life like everyone else. They require an inexpensive hand that also provides high functionality comparable to the human hand, which is also light and comfortable enough and reliable to use for everyday activities. We also intend to produce a prosthetic using electromyo-</p>

<p>graphic methods that’s water proof and resistant to deformation.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p><strong>Customers:</strong>
•Amputees with loss of forearm
•Parkinson's disease victims
<strong>Needs:</strong>
•Inexpensive prosthetic hand
•Hand with great degree of motion i.e comparable to the human hand
•Reliable to use for everyday activities eg writing, picking objects
•Resistant to deformation (scratches, corrosion)
•Water proof
•Should be light and comfortable enough 
<strong>Barriers:</strong>
•People have not explored cheaper electromyographic methods 
•The strength of the material to be used should provide swift motion but at the same time, be rigid
•Inability to provide long-lasting equipment through 3D printing
<strong>Advantages:</strong>
•Ours will be a cost-effective alternative for amputees
•It will present a non-invasive method of prosthesis
•It will be easily detachable which can be advantageous for cleaning/general maintenance, but resistant enough to minor impact.
•Other hands have to be manually adjusted for specific hand gestures, in ours, that problem is almost eliminated.</p>

<a id="meet-the-team" class="anchor" href="#meet-the-team" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Meet the Team</h3>

<p><strong>Ayotunde Odejayi:</strong>
I hail from Lagos, Nigeria and I am a senior studying Electrical Engineering at Howard University. As the 
leader of this senior design project, I ensure this  group of talented  individuals function  as  a  cohesive unit.  My  focus,  though,  is  programming  the  microcontrollers  and  tapping/translating  the electromyographic signals to  control the  corresponding motors.  This  also  includes  building  necessary circuitry.</p>

<p>I  plan  to  gain  tremendous  knowledge/expertise  over  the  next  few  years,  establish  important connections  and  harness  relevant  resources  that  will  be  key  to  founding  an  electrical  hardware engineering company back home that will compete globally.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Chase:</strong></p>

<p>I am a Senior Computer Engineering candidate at Howard University from Okinawa, Japan. I am here to help Ayotunde with the organization of the team as well as aiding Ayotunde with the programming, tapping/translating, and building necessary circuitry.Upon graduation, I will be commissioning into the U.S. Navy as an Ensign and will no longer be able to help or contribute to this project.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew Clarke:</strong>
I am a Mechanical engineering senior at Howard University. I'm from the island of Barbados. I am in charge of designing the 3D printed hand by using CAD drawing models. I plan to go to grad school in the near future and advance my learning. In my free time, I like to play tennis and take walks/runs.</p>

<p><strong>Bibek Ramdam:</strong>
I am a Freshman, Mechanical Engineering, from Nepal. I am working to build the hand, researching on current prosthetics, and finding shops to buy the parts required. In my free time I practice Taekwondo. I want to become a Robotic Engineer.</p>

<p><strong>Taylor Hines:</strong>
My name is Taylor Hines, and I am a sophomore mechanical engineering major at Howard University from Jeffersonville, Indiana. Howard University has allowed me to become academically and socially well rounded. On campus I am a member of Phi Sigma Rho National Sorority, Engineers Without Borders, ASME, NSBE, and the Howard University Women’s Flag Football Team. My task for Team Terminator will be to assist with designing  and 3D printing the Terminator Arm. I am interested in conducting Biomedical Engineering research in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Scoon:</strong>
Chemical Engineer, Freshman 
Trinidad and Tobago 
My task is to work alongside Jeantelle Francis to fabricate the heat detection features of the prosthetic arm.My  hobbies  and  activities  include rugby, swimming,  guitar,  piano  and singing.  I  am  a member  of the Freshman Leadership Academy, NSBE and the cook hall stroll/step team. In the future I intend on obtaining my MBA, Masters in Chemical Engineering and eventually develop and manufacture a leading product that benefits the global community.</p>

<p><strong>Jeantelle Francis:</strong>
Civil Engineer Freshman
Trinidad and Tobago
My task is to work alongside Andrew Scoon fabricating the heat detection features of the prosthetic arm.</p>

<p>My future goal is to specialize in structural design and give birth to my own construction company.In my free time I enjoy trying new food. I like to live by the wise words of Anna Thomas, "We all eat, and it would be a sad waste of opportunity to eat badly."</p>

<p><strong>Allee Clark:</strong>
Webmaster, etc.</p>
